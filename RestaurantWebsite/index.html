<!-- COMMENT ON PREVIOUS CODING EXPERIENCE:
I have some HTML experience coming from previous websites and graphics that I made in college, I was more comfortable with website
creation and understanding of basic elements, I was able to use this knowledge in the design aspect of the website, use of span classes, 
fonts, colours, flexboxes etc.
